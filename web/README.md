# SafeDetect Web App

A React.js web application for real-time object detection and blind spot monitoring.

## Features

- **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D truck model with object detection overlays
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time connection to the detection backend
- **Blind Spot Monitoring**: Visual and audio alerts for objects in blind spots
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean dark theme with intuitive user experience

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks
- **React Three Fiber**: 3D graphics rendering
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library
- **Webpack**: Module bundler
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication

## Installation

1. Navigate to the web directory:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Start the Backend**: Make sure the Python detection backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/aymanallouch/Desktop/SafeDetect python computer_vision/blind_spot.py
   ```

2. **Connect**: The web app will automatically connect to `ws://localhost:8765`

3. **View Detections**: Objects will appear as colored spheres around the 3D truck model:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green spheres: Cars
   - ðŸŸ  Orange spheres: Motorcycles  
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow spheres: Pedestrians

4. **Blind Spot Alerts**: Objects in blind spots will trigger visual alerts and browser notifications

## Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene
- **Reconnect Button**: Manually reconnect to the WebSocket server
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Development
